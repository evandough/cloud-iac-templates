# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Projects

This repository is a collection of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** projects that reflect my journey in learning, applying, and improving **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** skills.

## What You'll Find Here
A collection of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates for provisioning and managing cloud resources. 

- **ARM Templates**
- **Terraform**
- **Bicep**
- **AWS CloudFormation**

Each folder contains a self-contained project focused on automating specific cloud resources.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to **sharpen my skills in writing and understanding IaC** across different cloud platforms and tools. By building equivalent infrastructure using different IaC frameworks, I aim to:

- Understand the syntax and capabilities of each tool.
- Compare approaches across **Azure** and **AWS**.
- Practice real-world IaC scenarios in a modular, reusable way.

## Notes

This repo is a work in progress and will continue to grow with new examples and improvements.
