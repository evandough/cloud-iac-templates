# Terraform Projects

This repository is a collection of **Terraform** projects that reflect my journey in learning, applying, and improving **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** skills.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to **sharpen my skills in writing and understanding Terraform** across different cloud platforms and tools. By building equivalent infrastructure using different IaC frameworks, I aim to:

- Understand the syntax and capabilities.
- Compare approaches across **Azure** and **AWS**.
- Build a solid foundation to then built on top of. 

## Projects

| Folder                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `terraform-iac-folder/` | A Terraform specific folder. |
| `terraform-iac-folder/azure` | A Terraform specific folder - deploying to Azure. |
| `arm-template-folder/`  | An ARM Template specific folder **coming soon**. |

## Notes

This repo is a work in progress and will continue to grow with new examples and improvements.
